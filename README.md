# CPU-Processor-Pipeline

This is a program which simulates a CPU pipeline , which outputs a 5-stage pipeline with the following stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode and Read Operands (ID), Instruction Issue and Execute (EX), Memory access (MEM), and writeback results/retire (WB). The trace files used in this experiment are simplified versions of traces from the first value prediction championship (https://www.microarch.org/cvp1/) with one mainly integer trace, one floating point trace, and one server trace. Each trace has approximately 30 million instructions. 

This project is made by Adam Avdic , David (Gibum) Kim & Gurmehar Singh in-accordance to our CMPT 305 Project given by Dr. Alaa Alameldeen.
